== Debug Mode

=== Updated Debug Mode concept

Currently D-MODE is a special processor mode with behavior significantly different from behavior
in normal modes. And that behavior is fixed and cannot be changed. We propose to generalize Debug
Mode and treat it as a special mode with set of programmable run control parameters regulating all
relevant aspects of HART behavior: PC advancement, exception enabling, events of redirection to
D-MODE etc.

Main proposed changes in the Debug Mode concept:

1. *Unambiguous Debug Mode state machine.*
Firstly, it is necessary to define a state machine associated with actions around Debug Mode and
transitions between it and normal operational modes (U/S/M-modes). That gives us explicit definition
of relevant debug states, conditions of transitions between them and permitted operations in each
of them. Such a formal description makes specification of other debug aspects unambiguous and more
precise and is included as part of this proposal.

2. *Debug Mode Run Control parameters.*
Adding in the Debug Module register address space two sets of Run Control parameters:
the first set - to define execution parameters in D-MODE, and second - for the execution in the
normal mode after resuming from D-MODE. These Run Control Parameters can be defined, for example,
as potential "departures" from the standard behavior in the corresponding mode. Then, implementation
of those bits could be made optional for simpler implementations, and the case when all the bits
are not implemented should be very close to the current Debug Mode behavior. Register with those
Run Control Parameters can be added to the HART's Debug CSRs.

3. *Debug Mode redirection.*
To introduce Debug Mode redirection mechanism, which should allow entering Debug
Mode upon various events, including exceptions and interrupts. The redirection should be controllable
on the per-privilege mode basis. Control status registers for this mechanism should be placed in
the Debug CSR address space. 

4. *Special Debug CSRs for exceptions processing.*
The following exception-processing Debug CSRs are added: 
DEPC, DCAUSE, DTVAL. That provides important additional facilities:

* Allows processing of exceptions raised during Program Buffer instructions execution (while HART
is in Debug Mode)

* Allows to introduce in exception processing model additional intermediate state - when exception is
raised but not committed to architectural state, and on that basis to extend exception handling
capabilities

5. *Debug Program Buffer PC register.*
Debug Program Buffer PC register (DPPC CSR) is added for dealing with PC values during Program Buffer instructions execution. That helps
in saving architectural PC value intact (inside DPC) over Debug Mode execution series.

6. *Debug Mode context saving.*
Two CSRs (DSAVE0/1) are added to accommodate architectural context saving over a Debug Mode session.
Those registers are expected to be used as a backup storage for 1-2 GPRs used as intermediate
registers in Program Buffer procedures. That addition together with DPPC, DPC registers and PRV/DPRV bits
in DRUNCONTROL allows storing of HART-specific context of typical Debug Mode session inside the HART,
and makes debug facilities more robust to debug session breaks.


=== Hart Debug States

The proposed set of debug states and their interdependencies are shown in
<<RISCV_DBGSPEC_PROPOSAL_DMODE_STATES_IMG>>.

From the debug operations prospective HART has the following debug states (or macro-states, to be precise):

* RESET: state the HART has when its hardwire reset signal is activated
* RUN: corresponds to the normal instruction execution operational mode with U/S/M privileges
* HALTED: this is the state the HART has after WFI instruction execution
* D_HALTED (Debug Halted): this is the state the HART has upon the entry into the Debug Mode
* D_RUN (Debug Run): corresponds to the state when HART executes instructions from Program Buffer while
it is in Debug Mode

RUN and HALTED states correspond to the Non-Debug (or Normal) Mode, whereas D_HALTED and D_RUN
states comprise Debug Mode.

[[RISCV_DBGSPEC_PROPOSAL_DMODE_STATES_IMG,Figure {counter:myimgnum}]]
.Debug States of HART
image::debug_states_1.png[image,width=740,height=792]

==== RESET

HART transits to RESET state from any other state upon assertion of its hardwire reset signal.

All HART architectural registers (GPRs, FPRs, CSRs) changes their values to the reset-specific
ones as defined in the RISC-V ISA Spec.

In that state all HART-specific debug parameters (called Debug Context), including Debug CSRs,
stay intact, as they are stored in the Debug Interface module independent of the HART's reset.
Debug Interface is described in the section "Interaction between Debug Module and HART".

After reset signal de-assertion HART may transit to one of the following states:

* RUN, if there is no debug halt request from the HART's Debug Interface.

* D_HALTED, if HART's Debug Interface activates debug halt request. That may be the case
when at least one of the following is true: 1) HART was in Debug Mode before reset assertion;
or 2) Debug Module asserted halt request for the given HART.

==== RUN

RUN is the normal HART instruction execution operational mode with U/S/M privileges. Its behavior is
fully defined by the RISC-V ISA spec and depends on HART's architectural state (set of all HARTs GPRs, FPRs and
CSRs).

HART may transit to the RUN state from:

* RESET state - after hardware reset signal de-asserion, if the HART is in Non-Debug Mode
* D_HALTED state - as a result of resuming from Debug Mode
* HALTED (optional) - after an interrupt activation

HART may leave the RUN state to:

* D_HALTED state - as a result of redirection to Debug Mode upon external (debug halt request) or internal
(single step, EBREAK, hardware breakpoint, exception redirection etc) events.
* HALTED state (optional) - after WFI instruction execution.

==== HALTED (optional)

HALTED is the state the HART has after WFI instruction execution. Upon entry, HART is halted
until the next active interrupt. That state could be considered as optional, or to be treated as a
sub-state of RUN.

==== D_HALTED

D_HALTED is the state the HART has after entry to Debug Mode. HART is halted, and
operational context is changed to the one of Debug Mode, and HART's behavior is defined by Debug Spec.

HART may transit to the D_HALTED state from:

* RESET state - after hardware reset signal de-asserion, if the HART is in Debug Mode
* RUN state - as a result of redirection to Debug Mode upon external (debug halt request) or internal
(single step, EBREAK, hardware breakpoint, exception redirection etc) events
* HALTED (optional) - as a result of redirection to Debug Mode
* D_RUN state - as a result of redirection back to D_HALTED state after Program Buffer program completion
or unexpected exception raising during that program execution

HART may leave the D_HALTED state to:

* RUN state - as a result of resuming from Debug Mode
* HALTED state (optional) - as a result of resuming from Debug Mode with DRUNCONTROL.wfi bit set
* D_RUN state - when Program Buffer execution is started

==== D_RUN

D_RUN is the state when HART executes instructions from Program Buffer while
it is in Debug Mode. HART's behavior is defined by Debug Spec.

HART transits to the D_RUN state from D_HALTED state when Program Buffer execution is started.

HART leaves the D_RUN state toward D_HALTED state as a result of redirection back after Program Buffer program completion
or unexpected exception raising during that program execution.


=== Interaction between Debug Module and HART

All interactions between Debug Module (DM) and HART are carried out via HART Debug Interface Module (HDIM).
HDIM has a set of its own states controlling debug behavior of HART:

* Debug CSRs - these are considered as a part of HDIM
* some set of micro-architectural states (registers possibly not exposed externally) supporting
Debug States and transitions between them

That set of HDIM internal states is called HART Debug Context.

HDIM formally can be considered as a part of a HART, but its reset is independent from HART's reset. HDIM must be
reset together with the Debug Module.

=== Run Control Parameters

Central point in the proposed new Debug Mode concept is the change from the fixed, very specific run
control setup for execution in Debug Mode context, to an orthogonal set of programmable run
control parameters regulating all debug relevant aspects of the HART behavior.

Two sets of such run control parameters are required:

* Debug Run Control Parameters (DRCPs) - parameters regulating HART behavior while it is in Debug Mode,
during execution of Program Buffer instructions (in the D_RUN state)
* Run Control Parameters (RCPs) - parameters regulating HART behavior after resuming from Debug Mode,
while it is in the RUN state

Basically, these parameters define potential "departures" from the standard behavior in the
corresponding mode. Standard behavior of HART for Debug and Non-Debug Modes can be different. 
Then, implementation of those parameters could be made optional
for simpler implementations, and the case when all the bits are not implemented should be very
close to the current Debug Mode behavior.

All RUN Control Parameters are in the Debug Run Control CSR (DRUNCONTROL) (refer to
section 1.6). DRCPs and RCPs are located in the upper and lower halves of the register, respectively.

RCPs are used after resuming from Debug Mode, when HART is in the RUN state. That group includes
the following parameters:

* Privilege Level - the field behaves like the PRV field in the DCSR of the Debug Spec 0.13
* Single Step option - enforces redirection to D-MODE after single instruction execution
* Interrupt Disable - prohibits interrupts in RUN state
* Redirecting Exception Disable - prohibits commit of the exception-related changes into architectural
state upon redirection to D-MODE caused by that exception. The parameter influences processing of
all exceptions but Breakpoint exception
* Redirecting EBREAK Enable - allows commit of changes into architectural state related to the
Breakpoint exception (due to both EBREAK execution and hardware breakpoint from Trigger Module).
The parameter inverts default redirection to Debug Mode behavior upon Breakpoint exception 
(which is to discard architectural changes)
* Exception Commit - control flag, forces HART to commit exception data from Debug CSRs
(DCAUSE, DEPC, DTVAL) to the corresponding architectural CSRs after resuming from D-MODE. The option
is described in the section "Exception /Interrupt Handling"
* Wait For Interrupt - an option allowing to transit to the HALTED state after resume, i.e., the state
identical to the one after WFI instruction execution
* Trigger Module Disable - option prohibiting Trigger Module actions in the RUN state.
* Trace Disable - option reserved for future use with the Trace Module

DRCPs are used when HART is in the D_RUN state. That group includes the following parameters:

* Debug Mode Privilege Level - the field is used to control privilege level of the Program Buffer's
instructions
* Debug Single Step - allows debugging of the Program Buffer's code
* Debug Interrupt Enable - allows interrupts in the D_RUN state; could be used for interrupt
processing by the Program Buffer procedures
* Debug Redirecting Exception Enable - allows commit of the exception-related changes into architectural
state upon redirection to the D_HALTED state caused by that exception. The parameter influences processing of
all exceptions but Breakpoint exception
* Debug Redirecting EBREAK Enable - allows commit of changes into architectural state related to the
Breakpoint exception
* Debug Exception Commit - control flag, forces HART to commit exception data from Debug CSRs
(DCAUSE, DEPC, DTVAL) to corresponding architectural CSRs after transition to D_RUN state. The option
is described in the section "Exception /Interrupt Handling"
* Debug Wait For Interrupt - allows to imitate Wait-For-Interrupt state during instructions
execution in the D_RUN state
* Debug Trigger Module Enable - allows Trigger Module actions in the D_RUN state.
* Debug Trace Enable - option reserved for future use with the Trace Module; it should allow tracing of
Program Buffer's instructions execution
* Debug PC Altering Enable - allows changing of Program Counter during the Program Buffer execution.
By default, the PC altering is disabled
* Debug Privilege Level Altering Instructions Enable - allows proper execution of the instructions, changing
privilege level; by default such instructions are prohibited and cause Illegal Instruction exception
* Debug Counter Enable - allows increment of HART-local counters in the D_RUN state

All DRCPs except Debug Mode Privilege Level field are cleared after transition from the RUN or the HALTED state to 
the D_HALTED state, ensuring default behavior after redirection to Debug Mode. 
After transition from the RUN or the HALTED state to the D_HALTED state 
the Privilege Level field contains the privilege level value the HART had in the RUN state just before that transition. 
That means the default privilege level is the same as it was in the program just interrupted.
Transition from the D-RUN to the D_HALTED state itself does not change
parameter values, however, the privilege level might be changed during Program Buffer instructions execution,
if that is allowed by DRUNCONTROL.dprv_inst_enbl bit.

=== Exception/Interrupt Handling

Another proposed feature of the Debug Mode is capability of flexible exception/interrupt handling
in Debug Mode for debugging or testing purposes. 
This feature is enabled by a combination of the already introduced modifications in the Debug Mode concept:

* Introducing of D-MODE redirections due to exceptions/interrupts

* Treating of D-MODE redirection as a sort of exception, with registering its details in
Debug CSRs (DCAUSE, DEPC, DTVAL)

* Adding of the Run Control Parameters, in particular, Redirecting Exception Disable, Redirecting EBREAK
Enable and their D_RUN counterparts

The state diagram of debug exception handling is shown in <<RISCV_DBGSPEC_PROPOSAL_EXC_HANDLING_IMG>>.

Conventional exception handling by software in normal, Non-Debug Mode can be described as a 
sequence of the following steps:

* Exception assertion (sub-state 1 in the diagram): it is a situation when an exception
is detected, HART's pipeline is halted and flushed, but exception data is not committed to the
HART's architectural state yet

* Exception commit (sub-state 2): the fact of the exception and all relevant exception data are
committed to architectural state; HART's architectural state is also modified for a jump to a
software exception handler vector

* Execution restarts with the new architectural state (sub-state 3): pipeline performs jump to a
software exception handler vector, and that restarts execution from the new point and with the new
architectural context

Capability of D-MODE redirection upon exception and Run Control Parameters extend this picture
with two variants of D-MODE redirection (transitions 4 and 6), and two variants of resuming from
D-MODE (transitions 5 and 7).

*Transition 4: D-MODE redirection w/o exception commit*

It takes place if DRUNCONTROL.re_dsbl = 1 (for all exceptions except Breakpoint) or
DRUNCONTROL.re_break_en = 0 (for Breakpoint exception). Exception data is registered only in the 
exception-related Debug CSRs (DCAUSE, DEPC, DTVAL), the architectural CSRs do not contain
information about the exception which triggered the redirection.


[[RISCV_DBGSPEC_PROPOSAL_EXC_HANDLING_IMG,Figure {counter:myimgnum}]]
.Debug exception handling state diagram
image::debug_exception_handling.png[image,width=740,height=792]

*Transition 6: D-MODE redirection with exception commitment*

It takes place if DRUNCONTROL.re_dsbl = 0 (for all exceptions except Breakpoint) or
DRUNCONTROL.re_break_en = 1 (for Breakpoint exception). Exception data is registered both in the 
exception-related Debug CSRs (DCAUSE, DEPC, DTVAL) and in the architectural CSRs.

*Transition 5: simple resume from D-MODE (to the RUN state)*

If debugger requests traditional resume from D-MODE (the one described in the Debug Spec currently),
the HART transits from sub-state 4 to sub-state 3 via ark 5. In that case, HART mainly inherits the
architectural state it had just before that transition (with an exception of the privilege level). During
that transition a set of Run Control Parameters (RCPs) is also applied including the privilege level for
sub-state 3 and the following execution. RCPs are taken from the lower half of DRUNCONTROL register.

The transition could be used in the following cases:

* if HART is redirected to sub-state 4 via transition 4 (w/o exception commit), and debugger wants
to repeat execution of the instruction triggering the exception

* if HART is redirected via transition 6 (with exception commit), and debugger wants to continue
exception processing in software

* independently of redirection method, debugger on its own made some modifications in the architectural
state (i.e. with debugging purposes) while being in D-MODE, and wants to restart execution from the new point

*Transition 7: resuming from D-MODE with exception data commit*

This transition is similar to the transition 5 with one difference: exception-relevant data are
copied from Debug CSRs (DCAUSE, DEPC, DTVAL) to the corresponding architectural CSRs, as well as exception
indication. So, in that case HART will continue to process the exception (interrupted by redirection or even
composed artificially in D-MODE by debugger).

To initiate resume via transition 7, bit DRUNCONTROL.e_commit must be set.

*Architectural state read and modification*

While HART is in D-MODE, its architectural state (GPRs, FPRs, CSRs) can be read and modified in two
ways:

* directly by Abstract Commands (if that is implemented for the corresponding registers). In the diagram
this is reflected by sub-state 6 and transitions 10 and 11.

* by the Program Buffer instructions execution (it's done indirectly by Abstract Commands), if the Program
Buffer is implemented. In the diagram that corresponds to sub-state 5 and transitions 8 and 9.

==== DPC, Debug Program Counter Register (0x7b1)

The behavior of DPC register is close to the one described in the Debug Spec 0.13.

Upon entry to the D_HALTED state from the RUN state, DPC is updated with the virtual
address of the next instruction to be executed. When resuming (transition to the RUN state),
the HART’s PC is updated to the virtual address stored in DPC. A debugger may write DPC to change
where the HART resumes.

==== DSCRATCH0/1, Debug Scratch Register 0/1 (0x7b2/0x7b3)

The register is used for data exchange between HART and Debug Module during Program Buffer's instructions
execution.

==== DEPC, Debug Exception Program Counter Register (0x7b4)

Upon entry to the D_HALTED state (both from RUN and from D_RUN states), DEPC behaves as the corresponding view
of MEPC (UEPC, SEPC or MEPC itself), depending on the privilege level in the previous state.

==== DCAUSE, Debug Cause Register (0x7b5)

Upon entry to the D_HALTED state (both from RUN and from D_RUN states), DCAUSE behaves as the corresponding view

==== DEREDIREN_M, Debug M-MODE Exception Redirection Enable Register (0x7b8)

DEREDIREN_M has a bit position allocated for every synchronous exception described in
the MCAUSE register (Table 3.6 of RISC-V Privileged ISA Spec rev 1.10), with the index of the bit
position equal to the value returned in the MCAUSE register. Breakpoint exception has
two bit positions corresponding to two possible origins of such exception - EBREAK instruction and
Trigger Module.

If corresponding bit is set and the HART is running in M-mode (RUN debug state), then assert of the corresponding exception causes
redirection of HART to Debug Mode (to D_HALTED state).

|Exception Redirection Enable

If the corresponding bit is set, the HART is running in the M-MODE (RUN debug state) and the corresponding exception is asserted,
the HART redirects to the D-MODE and halts (transits to the D_HALTED state). During this transition, HART's
architectural state changes in accordance with DRUNCONTROL.re_dsbl bit.

Bits:

* 0 — Instruction address misaligned
* 1 — Instruction access fault
* 2 — Illegal instruction
* 3 — Breakpoint due to EBREAK instruction
* 4 — Load address misaligned
* 5 — Load access fault
* 6 — Store/AMO address misaligned
* 7 — Store/AMO access fault
* 8 — Environment call
* 9 — Breakpoint from Trigger Module
* 10..11 — reserved
* 12 — Instruction page fault
* 13 — Load page fault
* 14 — reserved
* 15 — Store/AMO page fault

==== DEREDIREN_S, Debug S-MODE Exception Redirection Enable Register (0x7b9)

DEREDIREN_S has the same layout of bits as DEREDIREN_M.

If the corresponding bit is set and the HART is running in the S-mode (RUN debug state), 
then assert of the the corresponding exception causes
redirection of the HART to the Debug Mode (the D_HALTED state).


==== DEREDIREN_U, Debug U-MODE Exception Redirection Enable Register (0x7ba)

DEREDIREN_U has the same layout of bits as DEREDIREN_M.

If the corresponding bit is set and the HART is running in the U-mode (RUN debug state), 
then assert of the the corresponding exception causes
redirection of the HART to the Debug Mode (the D_HALTED state).

==== DIREDIREN, Debug Interrupt Redirection Enable Register (0x7bb)

DIREDIREN has the same layout of bits as MIDELEG and MIP CSRs. That means it has bit positions for all
the individual interrupts, and layout of bits matches to those of the MIP register.

If the corresponding bit is set, and the HART is running in corresponding privilege mode (RUN debug state),
then assert of the corresponding interrupt causes redirection of the HART to the Debug Mode (the D_HALTED state).

==== DPPC, Debug Program Buffer PC Register (0x7bc)

The behavior of the DPPC register is similar to the one of DPC but it serves transitions between
the D_HALTED and the D_RUN states.

Upon entry into the D_HALTED state (both from the RUN and from the D_RUN states), the DPPC is updated with the value
of the architectural Program Counter. When resuming to the D_RUN state takes place (during execution of
the Program Buffer instructions), the HART’s PC is updated with the virtual address, stored in DPPC.
That address is used as a starting address of the Program Buffer's procedure when the Program Buffer's
address mapping to the HART's address space is implemented and enabled. A debugger may write DPPC
to change it via the Abstract Commands which directly access Debug CSRs (without Program Buffer instructions execution).

==== DSAVE0/1, Debug Save Register 0/1 (0x7be/0x7bf)

These registers are used as intermediate data storage during
the Program Buffer's instructions execution.
